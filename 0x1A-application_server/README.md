Application server
What is an application server?
An application server is a software framework that provides a dedicated environment for running applications. Its primary role is to host, manage, and execute applications, typically web applications. Application servers act as an intermediary between the user's device (client) and the database server, facilitating the processing of business logic, data access, and other application-specific tasks.
